Control Scheme for Alpha Release

WASD - for player movement (W - up, A - left, S - down, D - right)
Arrow Keys - Slap Attack (directional based on which key pressed, 
i.e. left arrow key slaps to the left)

Cook by standing still in the vicinity of an active stove (not blacked out), this increases temperature
Temperature decreases when you slap, but you deal more damage if you have higher temperature

You can slap enemies and traps, slapping traps activates their effects!

Fill temperature bar to win!
